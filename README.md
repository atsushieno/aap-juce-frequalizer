This is an experimental port of [ffAudio/Frequalizer](https://github.com/ffAudio/Frequalizer) to [aap-juce](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-juce/).

It builds and the UI shows up as a standalone app, but aaphostsample crashes when we try to use it. Most likely due to incorrect default parameter retrieval.
