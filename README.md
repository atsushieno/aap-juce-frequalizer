This is an experimental port of [TheWaveWarden/odin2](https://github.com/TheWaveWarden/odin2) to [aap-juce](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-juce/).

It builds and the UI shows up, but there is a bunch of changes in the code (e.g. had to kill all those synchronous dialogs) and it probably doesn't work yet. No audible sound generated on aaphostsample either (because everything is set to default).
