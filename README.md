This is an experimental port of [ffAudio/Frequalizer](https://github.com/ffAudio/Frequalizer) to [aap-juce](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-juce/).

Now it builds, launches as a JUCE standalone app, can load on aaphostsample and apply the EQ. Not sure if the application result is correct (hard to guess without seeing the UI at the same time).
